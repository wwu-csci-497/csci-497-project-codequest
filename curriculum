After playing CodeQuest kids should have an understanding of:
 Variables including how to set and change their value
 Boolean logic
 Conditional statements with simple arithmetic and logic
 For loops, while loops, and loop exiting
 Simple code writing in Blockly

Teaching Flow:
 Provide simple introduction to coding in Blockly through solution of early in game logic puzzles.
 Transition into more elaborate Blockly coding with later in game word-to-code puzzles.

Level Flow:
1. Tutorial Level   - Intro to Variables
2. Level 1          - Variable Utilization, Boolean Logic, Intro to If Statements
3. Level 2          - Conditional Logic with Booleans and Arithmetic
4. Level 3          - Intro to Looping
5. Level 4+         - Skill Combinations and Advanced Topics

Tutorial: Variables
 - Set character variable equal to the character number (Setting integer value)
 - Set jump = space_bar (Setting boolean value)
 - Set teleport = true (End of level)

Level 1: Variable Utilization, Boolean Logic, Intro to If Statements
 - Solve logic puzzles 1-5 (If statement, Variable utilization, Boolean logic)
 
 Level 2+: In the works...
